      One of my favorite hobbies is weightlifting. I began lifting regularly in 2016
      and it quickly became a cemented part of my daily routine. I believe it is both
      mentally and physically important to understand the human body's capabilities
      and I love to talk about training techniques and regiments.

      Another passion of mine is gaming. I have been an avid gamer since I first played
      Halo at a friends house as a child. I have progressed from the Playstation 2,
      Xbox 360 and eventually landing on PC Gaming since 2012. I think of video games
       as a good way to clear the mind and help to maintain stress levels.
