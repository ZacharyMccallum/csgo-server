        <h2>Setup CS:GO Environment In Ubuntu 18.04 Server</h2>
        <h4>Upon instance creation completion, SSH into the Google Cloud Platform Instance via built-in service</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Step 1:</b> Perform System Updates <br>
          <b class="code">
            $sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade </b><br>
        </p>
        <p>

          <b>Step 2:</b> Install library package for SteamCMD
          <br>
          <b class="code">sudo apt-get install lib32gcc1</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Step 3:</b> Create a seperate user “steam” for running CS:GO. <br>
          sudo useradd -m steam <br>
          To validate the creation of steam - check the output of cat /etc/passwd <br>
          Create UNIX password for ‘steam’
          <br>
          Switch user to “steam” <br>
          <b class="code">su - steam</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>


          <b>Step 4:</b> Create an installation path directory where we download SteamCMD. <br>
          <b class="code">mkdir ~/Steam && cd ~/Steam </b><br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Downloading and Installing SteamCMD</h2>
        <p><b>Step 1:</b> Download the latest version of SteamCMD <br>
        <b class="code">wget https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz</b> <br>
        <b>Step 2:</b> Extract the downloaded file. <br>
        <b class="code">tar xf steamcmd_linux.tar.gz</b> <br>
        <b>Step 3:</b> Run SteamCMD script file <br>
        <b class="code">./steamcmd.sh</b><br><br>
          This file will download the update from steam
          After that, the updated steam will provide you the cmd prompt as shown below. <br><br>
          <b class="code">Steam></b> <br>

        <b>Step 4:</b> Set your CS:GO dedicated server install directory. <br>
        <b class="code">force_install_dir ./cs_go/</b> <br>
        <b>Step 5:</b> Login using an anonymous steam account here. <br>
        <b class="code">Steam> login anonymous</b> <br>

        <b>Step 6:</b> Finally, download and install CS:GO on the server. <br>
        <b class="code">app_update 740 validate</b> <br>
        </p>
        <div class="red-note"><b>Note:</b> This process will take an extended period of time to complete ~45 minutes for download, and another
          You will see “Success! App ‘740’ fully installed” as below.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>


        Allow Access on Server’s TCP and UDP Ports
        In order to connect the game server, TCP and UDP ports should be allowed to all the players from the server.
      </div>
      <div>


        Configuring the firewall to allow connections to the server

        Select "Firewall" on the left-hand side
        Click "create firewall rule" at the top
        Name your firewall rule
        For "Targets", select "All instances in the network" (provided you don't have any other servers)
        For "Source IP ranges", enter 0.0.0.0/0 to allow any IP addresses to connect
        Check "tcp", and enter 27015-27030,27036-27037
        Check "udp", and enter 4380,27000-27031,27036
      </div>
      <div>


        Register CS:GO Game Auth Token ID
        In order to run the game you need your steam token ID. Without a token ID, you won’t be able to host a game.
        Your steam account should be qualified for generating token ID. Check here for the requirements and get your token ID.
        Follow below picture to generate your auth token ID.

        Note: The appID 740 is the registered ID for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive dedicated server whereas appID 730 is the official game ID.
        You will generate a token ID similar to this X38F6E71A3B8G6FE08354AF5BE078.
      </div>
      Run CS:GO On Server
      There are specific commands to run different game modes. This means you have to enter different commands to run Causal, Competitive, and Deathmatch Mode. Below is an example of a command to run a casual match on de_dust2.
      Important: You should be inside the cs_go directory before you run the command.
      ./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon + game_type 0 + game_mode 0 + mapgroup mg_active + map de_dust2 + sv_setsteamaccount [token_here] THISGSLTHERE -net_port_try
      For different modes, you need to change the game_mode value.
      Casual = game_mode 0
      Competitive = game_mode 1
      Deathmatch = game_mode 2

      Replace “[token_here]” in the below command and enter.
      Configure autoexec.cfg
      In order to allow public users to acces the server, an autoexec.cfg file must be created and updated.

      Path to autoexec.cfg -
      Configuration used for this Project
      hostname "CS:GO Server - CSI3660"
      sv_setsteamaccount 78B07BAA206BCAA92927545EE2684564
      sv_minupdaterate 128
      sv_mincmdrate 128
      log on //This is set to turn on logging! Don't put this in your server.cfg
      rcon_password "yourrconpassword"
      sv_password "" //Only set this if you intend to have a private server!
      sv_cheats 0 //This should always be set, so you know it's not on
      sv_lan 0 //This should always be set, so you know it's not on
      exec banned_user.cfg
      exec banned_ip.cfg


      Note: If you cannot connect right away, please be patient! It takes some time to set up the server fully to be ready for action.
      CASUAL GAME MODE
      ./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon + game_type 0 + game_mode 0 + mapgroup mg_active + map de_dust2 + sv_setsteamaccount [token_here] THISGSLTHERE -net_port_try
      COMPETITIVE GAME MODE
      ./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon + game_type 0 + game_mode 1 + mapgroup mg_active + map de_dust2 + sv_setsteamaccount [token_here] THISGSLTHERE -net_port_try
      DEATHMATCH GAME MODE
      ./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon + game_type 1 + game_mode 2 + mapgroup mg_allclassic + map de_dust + sv_setsteamaccount [token_here] THISGSLTHERE -net_port_try
      You will see the public IP of your game server after entering the above command.
      Join CS:GO Server
      Launch steam application and open CS:GO. There are two ways you can join the game server.
      First, connect through the game console. For that enable the developer console.
      Get back to the dashboard and open the console using “~” keyword and type “connect < your-ip-address>”.
        Second, adding server IP to your favorite list. For that, go to the Community Server Browser.
        Click on the favourite tab.
        Add your server IP and connect it.
        Run CS:GO In Server’s Background
        Your game will be disconnected or stopped when you log out from the server.
        It is not possible to host the game staying logged in 24x7 on the server. So, we will host the game in a background session. By doing so, your game won’t stop until your server gets turned off.
        For that, we will install a screen application on the server.
        Install Screen In Ubuntu
        sudo apt-get install screen -y
        Install Screen In CentOS
        sudo yum install screen -y
        After installation, create a new session named “csgo” by typing:
        screen -R csgo
        Now run the game host command. In my case, I am running competitive game mode.
        ./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon + game_type 0 + game_mode 1 + mapgroup mg_active + map de_dust2 + sv_setsteamaccount [token_here] THISGSLTHERE -net_port_try
        When the game is hosted successfully, exit from that screen(detach) by pressing the keys at the same time.
        Crtl + a + d
        Now you are out of that session. To see the running background session type
        screen -ls
        You will get the output like this:
        There is a screen on:
        7166.csgo (Detached)
        1 Socket in /run/screen/S-stechalon.
        7166 is the ID and csgo is the name of the screen.
        To rejoin the detached screen type:
        screen -r 7166

        Install Web Services
        Before installing new software, it’s a good idea to refresh your local software package database to make sure you are accessing the latest versions. This helps cut down on the time it takes to update after installation, and it also helps
        prevent zero-day exploits against outdated software.

        Open a terminal and type:
        sudo apt-get update
        Let the package manager finish updating.

        Step 1: Install Apache
        To install the Apache package on Ubuntu, use the command:
        sudo apt-get install apache2
        The system prompts for confirmation – do so, and allow the system to complete the installation.

        <b>Start Apache:</b>
        sudo systemctl start apache2.service
