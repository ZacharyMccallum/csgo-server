    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>
      The objective of this project is to create a cloud-based private Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
      server to be able to play multiplayer matches with, and against people online. The server will keep
      track of player kills, and also allow users assigned to the admin group to customize their skin
      through an in-game menu. An automatic back-up script creates a log file showing the history of
      player kills over all time.<br><br>
